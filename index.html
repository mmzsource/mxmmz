 <p class="center">When you see a real artist, one who is really good at it, then you know
    right away that there’s such a thing as an art of motorcycle
    maintenance. <br></br>
 Art is anything you can do well, anything where there are options for doing
    it well or poorly. <br></br>
 And there are very few things in this world that don’t have options for
    doing it well. You can make an art out of anything. And I think that making
    an art out of your technical life is solving the problem of technology. <br></br>
 Quotes from Robert Pirsig, author of 'Zen and the art of motorcycle
    maintenance' and 'Lila'.</p>
