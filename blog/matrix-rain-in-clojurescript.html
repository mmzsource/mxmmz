 <p>Already done many times before, in many other languages, but I just had to
    scratch my geek itch ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
 <canvas id="matrixrain"></canvas>
 <script src="matrixrain-js/main.js"></script>
 <p>The source code can be found  <a href="https://github.com/mmzsource/matrixrain/blob/master/src/matrixrain/core.cljs">here.</a>
</p>
 <h2>Concepts</h2>
 <p>Instead of explaining the source code in detail, I thought it would be
   better to explain the concepts behind my design. In essence, I've created a
   grid of randomly changing symbols, where the drops of rain are 'overlayed' on
   that grid by manipulating the colors of the symbols.</p>
 <img alt="A grid of symbols" src="./matrixrain-img/matrix.png"></img>
 <div class="imgtxt-container"><img alt="raindrop coloring" src="./matrixrain-img/raindrop-short.png" class="container-img"></img>
 <div class="container-txt"><h2>Matrix Grid</h2>
 <p>First, I've filled the cells of the grid with randomly picked symbols.
     After making sure the symbols on the grid change in a rate that looks about
     right, the grid is already done. On to the raindrops.</p>
 <h2>Raindrops</h2>
 <p>Now the grid is in place, the raindrops need to get the right color:
     white for the head, the two symbols behind that a little bit gray(er) and
     then a green, descending gradient, followed by completely invisible grid
     symbols. After adding some randomization in raindrop length and raindrop
     speed, the raindrops are done as well.</p>
 <h2>Glueing it together</h2>
 <p>The  <a href="http://quil.info">Quil library</a>
  will take care of
     the rendering on canvas. It only needs to know what function to call to
     'update' the matrix state and what function to call to 'draw' the current
     matrix state. The comment blocks in my code mark the different
     responsibilities of the code sections: definitions of some constants and
     update rates; grid creation and randomly changing symbols in the grid;
     generating raindrop colors, length and speed; merging it all together in a
     'matrix state'; and finally configuring Quil to call the right functions.</p>
 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p>There are probably shorter, faster and smarter implementations out
     there. This was my first attempt at visualising matrix rain. I think the
     design is quite easy to understand and implement and the result looks
     pretty similar to the matrix rain as seen in the Matrix movies. According
     to  <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a>
  it took me 102
     lines of ClojureScript to get this matrix rain running on my screen. I hope
     it inspires you to create something similar in your own language of choice.
     Be sure to drop me a link on  <a href="https://twitter.com/MMz_">twitter</a>
  once it's up and running on
     your website.</p>
 <p>Happy coding!</p>
